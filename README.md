# SimpleNet in Pytorch
This is the pytorch implementation of our architecture SimpleNetV1(2016) .

Pytorch is different from caffe in several sections, and this made it a bit harder to have the architecture properly ported especially since I'm a complete newbie in Pytorch. However, thanks to [this great work](https://github.com/D-X-Y/ResNeXt-DenseNet), I could easily focus on the model and port the architecture and hopefully achieve my reported results in Caffe and also exceed them as well!
